# Project Overview:
This backend Java project serves as a vital component within the architecture of an e-commerce application,
providing extensive services for user management, 
order processing, user authentication, and security 
configuration. Leveraging the Spring Boot framework, 
the project focuses on the development of robust and 
scalable RESTful APIs.

## Project Structure:
### UserService
- Manages the creation, updating, and deletion of user accounts.
- Implements robust validation checks to ensure data integrity.
- Enables retrieval of user details by ID, username, and email.
- Facilitates the management of user favorite items and orders.

### ItemService
- Manages the entire lifecycle of items within the e-commerce platform, including creation, updates, and deletions.
- Enables the adjustment of item stock levels, ensuring accurate inventory management.
- Retrieves detailed information about a specific item based on its unique ID.
- Facilitates the search for items based on specific letters, enhancing the efficiency of the search functionality.

### OrderService
- Handles the creation, updating, and deletion of orders.
- Ensures proper submission and processing of orders, considering stock availability.
- Allows retrieval of order details, including the item list associated with each order.
- Manages the lifecycle of orders, distinguishing between temporary, open, and closed states.

### AuthenticationService
- Implements secure user authentication using Spring Security.
- Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to enhance the security of the authentication process.
- Provides a dedicated endpoint for obtaining JWT tokens based on user credentials.
- Enhances user data protection by validating usernames and passwords.

### Security Configuration
- Implements access control to secure endpoints based on roles and permissions.
- Integrates JWT authentication filters for token validation.
- Allows public access to specific user-related and order-related endpoints.
- Ensures H2 console access during development, with plans for securing it in production.

## Framework and Technology:

#### Spring Boot Framework:
- Utilizes the Spring Boot framework for streamlined development, minimizing boilerplate code and simplifying configuration.
- Exploits the built-in features of Spring Boot for creating RESTful APIs, enhancing productivity.

#### RESTful APIs:
- Adheres to RESTful principles, ensuring scalability and interoperability.
- Defines clear and consistent API endpoints for user management, order processing, and authentication.

#### Database Integration:
- Integrates with a database (H2 in development), employing Spring Data JPA for data access.
- Ensures data persistence and retrieval through well-defined repository interfaces.

#### Security Best Practices:
- Adopts industry best practices for security, including secure user authentication and authorization.
- Secures sensitive information using JWT tokens, enhancing data protection.
- Implements access control to prevent unauthorized access to certain endpoints.
